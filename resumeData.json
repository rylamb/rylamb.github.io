    "bio": "I was introduced to computers by my parents at a young age. Playing games on 8-inch floppy disks eventually turned into building gaming PCs. Inevitably, I attended college for computer technology where I learned about computer networking and server administration. After a four years of working in IT support and infrastructure I came to appreciate the power of programming. This appreciate led me to return to school in pursuit of a computer science degree. I finalized my computer science degree by completing a capstone where I wrote a DLL injector and a handful of PC game hacks, which spawned my interest in cybersecurity. I am currently working full-time as a software engineer by day, and pursuing a master's degree by night where I continue my passion for learning about all things software, cybersecurity, and malware related.",
